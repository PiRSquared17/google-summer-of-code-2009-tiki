TikiWiki CMS/Groupware is a full-featured, web-based, multilingual (35+ languages), tightly integrated, all-in-one Wiki+CMS+Groupware, Free Source Software (GNU/LGPL), using PHP, ADOdb, Zend Framework, jQuery and Smarty. It is actively developed by a very large international community. Tiki can be used to create all kinds of Web applications, sites, portals, knowledge base, intranets, and extranets.

Tiki offers a very large number of features "out-of-the-box", arguably more than any other Open Source Web Application. Highly configurable and modular, all features are optional and administered via a web-based interface.

Major features include a robust wiki engine, news articles, discussion forums, newsletters, blogs, file and image galleries, bug and issue trackers (form generator), a links directory, polls/surveys and quizzes, FAQs, banner management system, calendar, maps, mobile Tiki (PDA, VoiceXML and WAP access), RSS feeds, category system, tags, an advanced themeing engine (Smarty), spreadsheet, live support, shoutbox, inter-user messaging, menu generator, advanced permission system for users and groups, internal search engine, external authentication support, and much, much more.

<li>TikiWiki is used in tens of thousands of web sites/projects/communities/companies and is used by Firefox for their official support site. (support.mozilla.com)</li>
<li>TikiWiki is used as an intranet/extranet system in thousands of organizations and in this respect, users have repeatedly said that it is a far superior solution than closed sourced alternatives such as Sharepoint.</li>
<li>The vast collaborative documentation effort is 960 printed pages, which is a testament to the scope of the project -&gt; Over 200 contributors to the core source code base (via CVS/SVN) over the last 6 years.</li>

<p>How is TikiWiki CMS/Groupware different?</p>
<ol>
<li>TikiWiki has, by its all-in-the-core model, more built-in features than any other Open Source Web Application (as far as we know!). All features are just clicks away in the admin panel. No need to hunt down/install 3rd party plugins/modules. Because of the all-in-one design, the feature integration is very tight. </li>
<li>TikiWiki is the Wiki Way applied to software development. It is easy to join the community and to contribute. <a href='http://dev.tikiwiki.org/How+to+get+commit+access'>http://dev.tikiwiki.org/How+to+get+commit+access</a></li>
<li>TikiWiki is a rare hybrid of the CMS &amp; Wiki worlds. Most CMSs are not wiki-centric. And most Wikis are just wikis without the additional CMS functionality.</li>
</ol>
<p>According to various indicators, TikiWiki CMS/Groupware is, community-wise, top-tier amongst wiki software, and towards the top of the second tier as a CMS, after the "big 4" (Drupal, Joomla!, WordPress &amp; Plone). It is of course unique as a blend of both wiki software and more general purpose CMS.  <a href='http://www.ohloh.net/tags/wiki'>http://www.ohloh.net/tags/wiki</a>  <a href='http://www.siteground.com/compare_best_wiki.htm'>http://www.siteground.com/compare_best_wiki.htm</a>  <a href='http://www.ohloh.net/tags/content_management_system'>http://www.ohloh.net/tags/content_management_system</a> <a href='http://tikiwiki.org/CMS+Landscape'>http://tikiwiki.org/CMS+Landscape</a></p>
